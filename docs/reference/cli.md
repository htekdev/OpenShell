| `nemoclaw policy set <name>` | Apply or update a policy on a running sandbox. Pass `--policy <file>`. |
| `nemoclaw policy get <name>` | Show the active policy for a sandbox. Add `--full` for the complete policy with metadata. |
| `nemoclaw policy list <name>` | List all policy versions applied to a sandbox, with status. |

## Gateway Commands

Manage the OpenShell runtime cluster.

| Command | Description |

| `nemoclaw gateway select` | List all registered clusters (when called without a name). |

## Sandbox Commands

Create and manage isolated agent execution environments.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `nemoclaw sandbox create` | Create a new sandbox. See flag reference below. |
| `nemoclaw sandbox get [name]` | Show detailed information about a sandbox. When name is omitted, uses the last-used sandbox. |

| `nemoclaw sandbox delete <name...>` | Delete one or more sandboxes by name. |
| `nemoclaw sandbox connect [name]` | Open an interactive SSH session into a running sandbox. When name is omitted, reconnects to the last-used sandbox. |
| `nemoclaw sandbox upload [name]` | Upload files from the host into a sandbox. When name is omitted, uses the last-used sandbox. |
| `nemoclaw sandbox download [name]` | Download files from a sandbox to the host. When name is omitted, uses the last-used sandbox. |

### Sandbox Create Flags

| Flag | Description |

| `--name` | Assign a human-readable name to the sandbox. Auto-generated if omitted. |
| `--provider` | Attach a credential provider. Repeatable for multiple providers. |
| `--policy` | Path to a policy YAML file to apply at creation time. |
| `--upload` | Upload local files into the sandbox before running. |
| `--keep` | Keep the sandbox alive after the trailing command exits. |
| `--forward` | Forward a local port into the sandbox at startup. |
| `--from` | Build from a community sandbox name, local Dockerfile directory, or container image reference. |
| `-- <command>` | The command to run inside the sandbox. Everything after `--` is passed as the agent command. |

## Provider Commands

Manage credential providers that inject secrets into sandboxes.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `nemoclaw provider create` | Create a new credential provider. See flag reference below. |
| `nemoclaw provider get <name>` | Show details of a provider. |
| `nemoclaw provider list` | List all providers in the active cluster. |
| `nemoclaw provider update <name>` | Update a provider's credentials or configuration. |

| `nemoclaw inference delete <name>` | Delete an inference route. |
| `nemoclaw inference list` | List all inference routes in the active cluster. |

### Inference Create Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--routing-hint` | Short label that identifies this route (for example, `local`, `nvidia`, `staging`). Referenced by `allowed_routes` in sandbox policies. |
| `--base-url` | Base URL of the inference backend (for example, `https://vllm.internal:8000`). |

| `--protocol` | API protocol: `openai` or `anthropic`. Defaults to `openai`. |
| `--disabled` | Create the route in a disabled state. |

## OpenShell Terminal

`nemoclaw term` launches the OpenShell Terminal, a dashboard that shows sandbox
status, live logs, and policy decisions in a single view. Navigate with `j`/`k`,
press `f` to follow live output, `s` to filter by source, and `q` to quit.

Refer to {doc}`/sandboxes/terminal` for the full guide, including how to read log
entries, diagnose blocked connections, and interpret inference interception.

## Sandbox Name Fallback

Commands that accept an optional `[name]` argument, such as `get`, `connect`, `upload`, `download`, and `logs`, fall back to the last-used sandbox when the name is omitted. The CLI records the sandbox name each time you create or connect to a sandbox. When falling back, the CLI prints a hint showing which sandbox was selected.

If no sandbox has been used yet and no name is provided, the command exits with an error prompting you to specify a name.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NEMOCLAW_CLUSTER` | Name of the cluster to operate on. Overrides the active cluster set by `nemoclaw gateway select`. |
| `NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX_POLICY` | Default path to a policy YAML file. When set, `nemoclaw sandbox create` uses this policy if no `--policy` flag is provided. |

## Shell Completions

Generate shell completion scripts for tab completion:

```console
$ nemoclaw completions bash
$ nemoclaw completions zsh
$ nemoclaw completions fish
```

Pipe the output to your shell's config file:

```console
$ nemoclaw completions zsh >> ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

## Self-Teaching

Every command and subcommand includes built-in help. Use `--help` at any level to see available subcommands, flags, and usage examples:

```console
$ nemoclaw --help
$ nemoclaw sandbox --help
$ nemoclaw sandbox create --help
$ nemoclaw gateway --help
```
